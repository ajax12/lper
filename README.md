# lpr
This program performs either a linear, polynomial or (added in Rev. 5) an exponential regression [y=aebx] on a given data set of dependent and independent variables. 
The MAIN required files are included in two zip files (LPR6. Zip and DOSBox Megabuild 6.dmg.zip).
Refer to the Readme Rev 3 document for more complete information, including Installion instructions.
New in Rev. 6.2: When doing an Exponential Regression, the regression can't be done if a Y axis value is Zero or a Negative number. The program will not allow a Y axis value of Zero or a Negative number from being inputted.
**Note:** There have been three other versions of this program. They were released outside of GitHub. It was decided not to restart the version number back to 1 since if technically not true.
