# lpr
This program performs either a linear, polynomial or (new in this Rev. 5) an exponential regression [y=aebx] on a given data set of dependent and independent variables. 
The MAIN required files are included in two zip files (LPR5. Zip and DOSBox Megabuild 6.dmg.zip).
Refer to the Readme Rev 2 document for more complete information, including Installion instructions.

**Note:** There have been three other versions of this program. They were released outside of GitHub. It was decided not to restart the version number back to 1 since if technically not true.
